# Capsula

Version 0.9.1

**Capsula** - transform reusable markup, styles and behavior into powerful, reactive, and maintainable Web Components.

**Capsula** is a base class for Web Components with reactive states (signals) and granular effects.

## Key Features

* **Reusable Components**: Create highly modular and reusable components to encapsulate styles and behavior.
* **Declarative States**: Bring static, server-rendered content to life with dynamic interactivity and state management.
* **Signal-Based Reactivity**: Employ signals for efficient state propagation, ensuring your components react instantly to changes.
* ***Declarative Effects**: Use granular effects to automatically synchronize UI states with minimal code.
* **Context Support**: Share global states across your component tree without tightly coupling logic.
